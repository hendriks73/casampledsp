    <a href="http://www.tagtraum.com/casampledsp/" target="_top">CASampledSP</a> is a simple
    implementation of the <code>javax.sound.sampled.spi</code> interfaces based on Apple's
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Audio">Core Audio</a>. It focuses on decoding
    audio from many supported encodings and file formats to signed linear PCM.

    Obviously, since <em>CASampledSP</em> depends on OS X, it is not portable to other operating systems.
